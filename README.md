# Employee Management System (C++ Project)
![Project Screenshot](screeenshot(1).png)

This is a console-based **Employee Management System** built using **C++**, demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file handling, binary data storage, and a menu-driven interface.  
This project simulates a simple HR system where administrators can manage employee records efficiently without using a traditional database.
